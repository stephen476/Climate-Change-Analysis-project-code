# Climate-Change-Analysis-project-code

## Project Overview

A global research institution specializes in the monitoring of climate change across multiple dimensions and regions and requires an interactive dashboard for analyzing  climate trends. I will be creating a centralized, interactive dashboard to track key climate indicators, visualize extreme weather events, and assess their economic and infrastructural impact in real time.



__The organization faces critical challenges in:__
Tracking climate trends – Climate data is scattered and lacks a unified view,
making it hard to analyze temperature fluctuations, air quality shifts and precipitation patterns.

Generating actionable Insights – Traditional reports are static and time-consuming, slowing down decision-making processes. 

Assessing Climate Risks Visually – There is no structured way to visualize how extreme weather events impact infrastructure, population exposure, and economic stability across different regions.

__Solution__
To solve these issues I will be creating an interactive dashboard that provides real-time insights helping researchers and policymakers explore and analyze KPI’s in a flexible and interactive manner quickly identify climate risks and trends at a glance.
